Suppose there are two lists,
locus = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
gene =  [2, 3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 5, 11, 10, 12, 12, 9, 14, 11]
here each number represents labels of edges.
here in the list locus 1 has been set to a value of 2 in gene ; this means that edges 1 and 2 share a node and are in the same community. A decoding algorithm iterates through each gene of the individual to find all pairs of connected edges to build the communities of edges in the genotype. Here, edges 1 and 2 are in the same community (locus 1 has gene 2); edges 2 and 3 are also in the same community, and since 1 and 2 already belong to the sam community, edge number 3 joins this community. Followingthe same logic, edges 3 and 6, 6 and 7, 7 and 5, 5 and 4, 4and 1 are in the same community. So, one community willbe the set of edges 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (red edges). Edges8 and 11 are in the same community, and since 8 and 11 arenot assigned to any community yet, the decoding of a newcommunity starts. Accordingly, 8 and 11, 11 and 12, 12 and9, 9 and 10, 10 and 12, are in the same community (darkblue edges). Starting again, 13 and 14, 14 and 11, are in the same community. However, since 11 already belongs to the community dark blue, these edges will join the dark bluecommunity. So, the second community will be 8, 9, 10, 11,12, 13, and 14 (dark blue edges). With these 2 communitiesof edges, we can find the community of nodes. Note that thefinal result is that node 4 be overlapping since has edges that belong to both community of edges.now write the decoding algorithm in python
